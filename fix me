# Hi class, this is an example of an R file on Github. 


# Here I have some some code, but I misspelled tidyverse. Oops.
# Correct it and create a pull request.


# Load libraries
library(tidverse)


# Make a table
t(mtcars %>%
  select(mpg, cyl, disp, hp) %>%
  stat.desc(basic = FALSE))
  
# Click on the pencil button and edit the file. 
# You can also copy all of it and paste in in your R script and work on it. 
# When you are done editing (and pasting back)
# You can "commit changes". If no review is needed, yo can commit
# directly to the master branch. If you want someone to review it  first
# you choose the option create a new branch and start a pull request.
